**Retrieving feature flags for your project**

```javascript
import bulletTrain from "bullet-train-client or react-native-bullet-train"; //Add this line if you're using bulletTrain via npm

bulletTrain.identify("bullet_train_sample_user");

bulletTrain.init({
	environmentID:"<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY>",
	onChange: (oldFlags,params)=>{ //Occurs whenever flags are changed
	
		const {isFromServer} = params; //determines if the update came from the server or local cached storage
		
		//Check for a feature
		if (bulletTrain.hasFeature("myCoolFeature")){
			myCoolFeature();
		}
				
		//Or, use the value of a feature
		const bannerSize = bulletTrain.getValue("bannerSize");
		
		//Check whether value has changed
		const bannerSizeOld = oldFlags["bannerSize"] && oldFlags["bannerSize"].value;
		if (bannerSize !== bannerSizeOld) {
		
		}

	}
});
```
